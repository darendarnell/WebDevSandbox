# WebDevSandbox
A place to dump small projects and simple assignments that were created while learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and potentially other languages and frameworks. 

As of May 12, 2025, I am graduating with a BS in Computer Science in 3 days. I am starting the course "The Odin Project" to learn web development.
